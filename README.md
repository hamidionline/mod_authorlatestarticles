# mod_authorlatestarticles_v1.0.0
A usefull Joomla 3 module for your authors that shows in a table latest articles. Table contains title, category, published date, author, access level, if it is published, unpublished or pending and an edit button. This module is also compatible with K2 v2.6.9 .

There are two options inside the module. You can set the number of articles to display. There is no pagination at this moment. Also you can select source for your articles, Joomla! or K2.

There is a bug though. In order to work properly with K2 you have to publish the module under a K2 category. There is something wrong with the route in title link. 

Don't forget to enable K2 Frontend editing and create a K2 user group with the permission to edit articles.
